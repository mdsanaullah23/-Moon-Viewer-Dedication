# Moon Quality Precision Viewer

This is a simple web application that allows you to view images of the moon in different quality precisions. It's just a fun project created to dedicate to my future wife.

## How to Use

1. Choose the desired quality precision from the dropdown menu.
2. Click the "Submit" button to view the moon image in the selected quality precision.

## Dedicated to My Future Wife

The last image option (4K) is dedicated to my future wife. It's a symbolic gesture to express my love and dedication.

Feel free to explore the different quality options and enjoy the moon's beauty!
